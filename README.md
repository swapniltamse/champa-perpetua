A Love Letter

> A digital love letter expressed through code, celebrating the timeless beauty of someone I adore.

## Project Overview

This project represents a personal tribute created using web technologies. It combines elegant typography, subtle animations, and thoughtful prose to honor someone special in my life.

## Inspiration

On one of the cool March Saturday mornings I was mesmerized (again) by the freshness and maturity of my spouse.
Sharing so many trials and tribulations and still seeing one more day of hopefulness and happiness.

I told her, "I wish I was a painter and I could paint your beautiful presence right now".
She replied, "You are coder, code me".

That my friends, what triggered this project where I want to think of innovative ways to bring her presence and positivity through digital artworks.


This current project was inspired by the tradition of artists throughout history who have used their craft to celebrate those they love.

What M.F. Husain expressed through his bold, vibrant figures and Michelangelo through his masterful sculptures, I have endeavored to honor through patterns and algorithms â€“ a different language for the same timeless sentiment.
I decided to start with low-poly renditions. I plan to better my digital art in the future.
